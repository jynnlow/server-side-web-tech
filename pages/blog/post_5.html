        TNaples – the birthplace of Pizza, a city that has also gained notoriety for crimes and association with Mafia. 
        A few months before the trip, I got to know an Italian working in Singapore through a language exchange event. 
        He told me to be very careful there. 
        “If they see that you are not local, especially like you, they may approach you with bad intentions.”
      </p>
      <p>
        After the picketpocket incident in Rome, we were more cautious and maybe paranoid. 
        I was still fine with taking public transport to our hostel. 
        The rest chose not to risk it and with all the extra weight from shopping in the lugguage, 
        we decided to take a cab instead. 
        Turned out to be a good choice because there was a steep hill on the way to our hostel, Giovanni’s Home.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through the intercom on the ground floor, we informed Giovanni of our arrival.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Come in, take the stairs up to the 4th floor.”
      </p>
      <p>
        There was no elevator! As we were lugging up our luggage up the unevenly spaced step, 
        Yusra cried, “We should have checked if there is an elevator before we book the hostel.”
      </p>
      <p>
        My bad, I was the one in charged of planning for Naples and chose Giovanni’s Home because of the raving reviews.
      </p>
      <p>
        IGiovanni welcomed us with this cheeky smile that he always wears. We entered the apartment, panting like a dog.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Are you hungry?” he asked.
      </p> 
      <p>
        “Yes,” we uttered between our breaths. Lugging up our luggages up 4 stories exhausted our calories that were in need of replenishing.

        He sat us down at the common room and returned with 4 plates of pesto conchiglie pasta for us. 
        Being a sucker for pasta, I wolfed down everything, not leaving a single morsel on the plate. 
        Nadia could not finish her portion. 
        We thought it was rude to leave leftovers so I finished it for her. 
      </p>
      <p>
        After the simple and delicious meal, he sat us down at his desk, like 4 students waiting to be reprimanded by the teacher. 
        But no, he played a Youtube video and began singing an Italian song called Singapore by Nuovo Angelli.
        ”Do you know this song?” he asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Erm…. No…”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Ok, can I have your passport please?”
      </p>
      <p>
        He took our passports and broke into his singing spasm again.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the check-in was done, he lit a cigarette, reclined on his chair and asked, “So, what have you heard about Naples?”
      </p>
      <p>
        I told him what the Italian friend shared with me.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the rest enjoyed the beach at Praja A Mare, I stayed in hostel, 
        chatting with a Spanish and Argentinian couple who also came from Giovanni’s Home. 
        I could not enjoy anything. At times, I felt the impulsion to just take a train to Barile but no, 
        we were accountable for one another. When Yusra, Nadia and Khidir returned from the beach, 
        I did not know what to say or do. I was not angry with them, I was angry with myself for being delusional.

            It’s a nice confirmation when an author’s work is validated, and they can see the fruit of their labor.
