        May is the month when we celebrate Mothers’ Day. Little did I know, May is also Women Riders Month. 
        In celebration of this special month, Harley Davidson Singapore organised a ride solely for the ladies. 
        Sorry guys, you will be declined except for the organisers.It is a good time to bitch about our male counterparts 
        without their presence. Kidding, no, we have better things to do like enjoying the company and conversations 
        without any machismo.
      </p>
      <p>
        On a side note, I bumped into a colleague in the elevator a few weeks back. 
        He saw me with my helmet and asked, “You ride motorcycle ah?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “A scooter,” I said.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Isn’t it dangerous for female to ride?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “What makes you think so?”
      </p>
      <p>
        He seemed to take back his words now. That question peeved me a little. 
        I was being very polite not to ask, “What makes you think that growing a pair of balls 
        is going to make riding less dangerous?”
      </p>
      <p>
        Doesn’t testosterone-aroused road aggression imply some danger too? 
        I am not sure if that sweeping statement is well intended because he does not wish to see ladies get hurt. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Argh! If it is sooo dangerous for female to ride, I would not be standing before him 
        answering a stupid question with another question.
      </p>

        Sheriders Chapter is an all-women riding group. (We exist, we did not ride ourselves to extinction!) Kelly, 
        the founder, invited all the members. It was open to those with Class 2A and Class 2 bikes. I do not have the bike, 
        but I have the licence. No worries, I could borrow a Harley for the ride. Sound too good to be true? It was true! 
        I felt really privileged to be a lady for that day.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have never ridden a Harley Davidson bike before. So it was best that I head down to test ride 
        and select one that I am comfortable riding.
      </p>

        If you wish to test ride a HD bike, you can head down to their show room and request. 
        They are open everyday from 9am to 7pm even on Public Holidays. All you need to do is to let them 
        photocopy your driving licence and sign an indemnity form. What if you crash the bike? Their bikes are 
        covered by insurance. The place is near Alexandra Hospital. No worries but that does not mean you should do so!ß

            It’s a nice confirmation when an author’s work is validated, and they can see the fruit of their labor.
