          <h2>Celebrating Women Riders Month with Harley Davidson Singapore</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="blog-card-desc text-justify">
          <p>May is the month when we celebrate Mothers’ Day. Little did I know, May is also Women Riders Month. 
            In celebration of this special month, Harley Davidson Singapore organised a ride solely for the ladies. 
            Sorry guys, you will be declined except for the organisers.
            It is a good time to bitch about our male counterparts without their presence. 
            Kidding, no, we have better things to do like enjoying the company and conversations without any machismo.

        </div>
        <div class="blog-card-desc text-justify">
          <p>The road from Pai to Chiang Mai is just another 136km. More meandering roads were expected in this stretch. 
            At one point the bend was 90 degrees and up a 45 degrees incline.
            Nearing Chiang Mai, I had a small mishap. Maybe I was too tired. While we were stuck in the traffic, 
            I rest my back against my backpack on the rear. I got a little too comfortable and ended up falling to the side, 
            almost knocking the tuk tuk next to me. The tuk tuk driver got out and checked on her vehicle immediately. 
            A chap on a motorcycle nearby, stopped and scrambled to help me up. Once he checked that I was ok, he quickly left. 
            I did not even get a chance to know his name and thank him.

          <p>I was sent on a two weeks study trip in Japan, Shizuoka, of which, I spent the weekend in Tokyo. 
            Months before the trip,  I was given the uphill task of learning Japanese which I did not manage 
            to master very well.Whenever travelling to countries where the spoken language is not one I speak, 
            I would very least learn the following essential phrases and expression.

          <p>For that day’s ride, I wore another windproof jacket on top of my riding jacket. 
            The winter in Thailand was clearly underestimated despite friends’ warning.
            We started the day with a punctured tyre on Mike’s Sertao 650 and scouring Mae Sariang 
            for a bike repair shop where Mike’s tyre tubes was patched.

          <p>Khao Sok National Park – one of my favorite place in the 3 weeks trip. My friend Andy and Sim Eng suggested this place 
            and since it is on the way from Koh Samui to Phuket, we can pay a visit. Andy and Sim Eng spent around 2 and half months 
            riding around Thailand Laos etc. 
            They lent me their maps and shared a lot of information with me, a first time rider entering Thailand.
            They showed me photos of the Tree houses they stayed in, the lake and lake houses they visited.</p>
