          The road from Pai to Chiang Mai is just another 136km. More meandering roads were expected in this stretch. 
          At one point the bend was 90 degrees and up a 45 degrees incline.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nearing Chiang Mai, I had a small mishap. Maybe I was too tired. 
          While we were stuck in the traffic, I rest my back against my backpack on the rear. 
          I got a little too comfortable and ended up falling to the side, almost knocking the 
          tuk tuk next to me. The tuk tuk driver got out and checked on her vehicle immediately. 
          A chap on a motorcycle nearby, stopped and scrambled to help me up. Once he checked that 
          I was ok, he quickly left. 
          I did not even get a chance to know his name and thank him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The mishap cost me a broken right mirror and 500baht to replace it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just right next to where I fell, was an optical shop. For the past few days, 
          Wei Jie’s glass frame was flimsily held up with tapes. 
          We decided to stop for a rest while waiting for Wei Jie’s glasses to be fixed.
        </p>
        <p>
          We dropped by Riders’ Corner again as Wei Jie and Cherie have yet to say hi to Philip.
        </p>
        <p>
          It has been 6 days since I left Chiang Mai on my own to meet the rest. 
          Philip asked me how did it go?
        </p>
        <p>
          I shrugged my shoulders and said “OOkkkkk….” with no mention about what happened earlier. 
          I did not feel like talking about what happened.
        </p>
        <p>
          Philip’s wife kindly asked if we have our accommodation settled. 
          Riders’ Corner was already full so she brought us to another guest house nearby.

          For this trip, all I booked and planned was the flight ticket and nothing else. 
          It turned out that I have to stay one night in Bangkok. A few months before, I befriended Yuki while rock climbing in Krabi. 
          She lives and works in Bangkok so I contacted her to meet up. 
          Upon knowing that I have not arranged for a place to stay, Yuki kindly offered to put me up at her place. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The train arrived in the early hours. After Uncle Mike’s bike was unloaded from the train, we had our breakfast. 
          His ambitious plan was to ride from Bangkok to Hatyai in a day. That was more than 900km!
        </p>
        <p>
          After I washed up myself at the station, Uncle Mike made his trip south before the peak hour traffic thronged the roads. 
        </p>
        <p>
          As it was still very early in the morning, I stored my luggage and explored the vicinity while waiting for Yuki.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I met Yuki, I tried to sputter some broken Japanese to her. 
          After returning from Japan a month earlier, I realised I had forgotten most.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being a polyglot, especially in a foreign setting, it can be quite challenging to get the language frequency in tune. 
          Throughout our time together, she sometimes speak to me in Thai accidentally and sometimes in Japanese. 
          At times, I understood and replied her, many times, 
          I could not. Each time a language confusion happens, it gets us tickling.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yuki, thank you for your warm Japanese hospitality in Bangkok. I hope to meet you again, maybe in Japan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Special thanks to Wei Jie, Cherie and Uncle Mike for allowing me to join in the great company for 7 days.
