          I was sent on a two weeks study trip in Japan, Shizuoka, of which, 
          I spent the weekend in Tokyo. Months before the trip, I was given the 
          uphill task of learning Japanese which I did not manage to master very well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever travelling to countries where the spoken language is not one I speak, I would very least learn the following essential phrases and expression.
        </p>
        <p class="fw-bold">
          1. “Where is the toilet?”
        </p>
        <p>
          When your bladder is full, would you rather verbally express or physically express your desperately needed place for relief?        
        </p>
        <p class="fw-bold">
          2. To convey our dietary preference or restriction if any. “I don’t eat….” “I am a vegetarian.” “I am allergic to…..” “Not spicy.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Important especially if you have some health conditions or allergies!
        </p>
        <p class="fw-bold">
          3. “Thank you.” “Please.” “Excuse me.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Don’t leave your basic courtesy at home.
        </p>
        <p class="fw-bold">
          4. For overland travel, “Where is the petrol station?”
        </p>
        <p>
          English-speaking locals are hard to come by in small towns. If not sure, pointing to the fuel tank is quite explanatory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ok, with those essential phrases, and some simple phrases, particularly in asking for directions, 
          I set off to Japan!Being an ineffective polyglot, I sometimes spluttered something in Italian when I was asked something in Japanese.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I was in Tokyo looking lost while searching for Canon Service Centre to repair my camera, an old uncle approached me to ask if I needed help.
        </p>
        <p>
          I said in Japanese, “I am sorry. I do not understand Japanese.” He ended up looking just as lost and confused as I was and later said, 
          “But you speak Japanese!” That is what you get by with rudimentary grasp of a new language – confusing people. 
          First thing you learn to say is “I do not understand.” That is always taught in the first few lessons of Pimsleur Language Learning Audio.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of the time I was in the Shizuoka Prefecture for study. I was quite overwhelmed and impressed by the formality in the work culture over there, 
          a huge contrast to how I usually carry myself at work. 
          I was very conscious and wary about how I present myself to save us from embarrassment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The way that the staff were attentive to our needs were meticulous. My boss and I were fetched to work from our inn and they even 
          showed us the supermarket so we can get our food. My camera broke down, I was loaned a camera by them.
        </p>
        <p>
          We had to queue up to meet the superiors. As guest, we were made to sit. During the self introduction to the board of governor, 
          we had to stand up and say a speech in front of everybody. Nervous! When I managed to splutter a few phrase in Japanese during the meeting, 
          the board asked, “You speak Japanese.”
           When I ironically said in Japanese that I am not very good in the language again, the entire table broke into laughter.
